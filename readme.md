# Graph

Graph is a non-linear data structure, consisting of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes through edges.

### Types
- Unidirected Graph (Bidirectional Edges)
- Directed Graph

A binary tree can also be called a graph. Cycles included makes it DCG and no cycles make it DAG. Degree of a graph is the number of edges that go inside or outside that node.

- Unidirected : Total Degree of a graph = 2 X E
- Directed : Indegree, and Outdegree concepts
- Representation : Adjancency List or Adjacency Matrices
